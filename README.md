# 🎨 DailyDesignJourney

A **design-first learning repository** where I practice UI design daily as a **Frontend Developer**.

This repo is not about pixel‑perfect designs.
It is about building **design intuition** — spacing, alignment, hierarchy, and typography — and translating them into **real frontend code**.

---

## 🚀 Why This Repository Exists

As a frontend developer, writing code is not enough.
Good UIs are:

* easy to scan
* visually balanced
* readable
* intentional

This repository documents my **daily UI design practice**, inspired by challenges like **Daily UI**, and focuses on **design principles developers must know**.

## 🧠 Core Design Principles I’m Practicing

### 1️⃣ Whitespace (Breathing Space)

Whitespace is not empty space — it is a **design tool**.

What I focus on:

* spacing between sections (macro whitespace)
* padding inside components (micro whitespace)
* line-height for readability

Key mindset:

> If everything is loud, nothing is important.

---

### 2️⃣ Alignment (Invisible Structure)

Alignment creates **order and clarity**.

What I practice:

* grid-based layouts
* consistent margins & paddings
* avoiding “almost aligned” elements

Rule:

> If two elements relate, align them perfectly.

---

### 3️⃣ Visual Hierarchy (Guide the Eyes)

Visual hierarchy controls **what users notice first**.

I work with:

* font size & weight
* color contrast
* spacing
* CTA priority

Goal:

> Users should understand the UI without thinking.

---

### 4️⃣ Typography (90% of UI)

Typography defines how professional a UI feels.

What I focus on:

* font-size scales
* line-height & readability
* limited font weights
* good contrast

Fonts I mostly experiment with:

* Inter
* Roboto
* Poppins
